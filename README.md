Problem 1: 35m
This question really helped me get started in haskell and I just used the basic concepts from the slide to solve the questions. Hence, this question took me not too long. The last question was a bit confusing, since if we look at the input, they gave us a number which made me think to get a new account number from the existing one by removin the last digit and checking the original input is equal to the new account number. But after reading the pdf again, we only had to get the mod of the new account number.

Problem 2: 1h20m
The last part of this question took a while. We had done some parts of this problem in racket. And it was simple to duplicate it in haskell. The g and h function also did not take much time. But the d function was a bit confusing. I had to go over the instructions again and understand curried functions since they were being used in the program. After a while I got to know how to return a function from a function.

Problem 3: 2h10m
I took a time to figure out the fst and snd functions on sets and took a bit of time by going over the Set.hs file from where I got the input type. Using that, I simply made the power sets by taking the first element from the set one by one and adding it to the new set. The reason why it took a lot of time is also because I couldnt figure out how to return an empty set using singleton. Hence, after going through the files, I got to know how to do it at last.
